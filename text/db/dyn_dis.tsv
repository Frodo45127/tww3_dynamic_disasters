incidents_localised_description_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_stage_2_trigger	The Old World despairs, for Archaon the Everchosen, Champion of Chaos, has come and with him the End Times!\\n\\nOnce a Templar Priest of Sigmar, Archaon uncovered a terrible secret which drove him to reject his faith and pledge himself to the Gods of Chaos. In their service, he has devoted himself to the world’s destruction, defeating all challengers and rising to a position of dominance over all in the Chaos Wastes, achieving the ultimate accolade - his dark coronation as the Everchosen; the vessel through which the Dark Gods unite their followers to turn the world into a Realm of Chaos. It is to his banner that the Warriors of Chaos have been flocking, and it is his malign will that now drives them forth in a terrible wave of destruction destined to sweep all before it.\\n\\nThe earth groans beneath the iron-shod feet of Archaon’s numberless horde, and with him comes death. Is there any champion of the Old World mighty enough to withstand the Lord of the End Times?	true

incidents_localised_description_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_stage_1_trigger	Dire tidings from the North!\\n\\nThe tendrils of Chaos writhe and reach out from the accursed wastes, tainting the land and sowing dissent. Their corrupt forces wax ever stronger, and now their agents are abroad, spreading the foul corruption of their malign Gods.\\n\\nOn their heels come bands of marauding warriors led by the most zealous of the Chaos Lords, eager to wreak destruction in the name of the Ruinous Powers. And all the while, ever more warriors flock to some focal point in the Chaos Wastes, a nexus of power which transcends their petty rivalries and impels them to join with the numberless horde.\\n\\nDoom approaches, and it is only in strength that any hope may be found!	true
incidents_localised_title_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_stage_early_warning	Chaos Stirs	true
incidents_localised_description_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_stage_early_warning	Storm clouds gather in the North. There are rumours that the barbarous tribes residing in the shadow of Chaos have ceased striving against each other for the attention of the Dark Gods and are instead banding together. Suckling at the teat of Chaos, the hordes grow in strength. It seems only a matter of time before the dam breaks and a tide of ruin bursts forth to engulf the Old World, corrupting or destroying all in its path.\\n\\nMarshal your strength, nurture the sinews of war, build your walls high, gather warriors to your banner and temper them in the crucible of battle, so that when the time comes you may yet weather the storm!	true

incidents_localised_title_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_finish	An Age of Peace?	true
incidents_localised_description_dyn_dis_chaos_invasion_finish	As the last of the Chaos hordes is scoured from the face of the world, an awful silence descends. More than a silence; an absence of sound which echoes the all-consuming void without. All creation is stilled, breath held in anticipation of the final cataclysm.\\n\\nThen, tentatively, gently, life reasserts itself. Not in a grand way to echo those who sought to end everything, but in the small ways which of themselves are life. Birdsong pierces the silence, hesitant at first, then swelling; a defiant hymn to creation, borne on a soft wind that sifts dust onto the scattered corpses littering the bloody plain of battle. And the spell is broken. Bloodied veterans, survivors, refugees - all draw breath into their aching lungs and weep at the taste and smell of victory, peace, and life.\\n\\nYet what is life if not the constant striving of one against the other? After all, every hedgerow is a bloody battleground, every plant a murderer, every creature red in tooth and claw. Even as the weak raise their eyes to a golden future, the wise are glancing about to see who will make the first move in seizing it for themselves. The shield of civilisation which turned aside the deadly thrust of Chaos is now a heavy and cumbersome thing. Those who are first to cast it aside will be quickest with their blades, and a knife in the back is surest of all. Comrades who stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the shield wall now step apart and take each other’s measure. Alliances begin to unravel and the storm clouds gather once more.	true
