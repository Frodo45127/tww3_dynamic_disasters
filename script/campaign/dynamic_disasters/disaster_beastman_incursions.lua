    Beastmen Incursions, By Frodo45127.

    IDEA: Mid-late game repeatable disaster where beastmen start spawning in great numbers on certain beastmen-related regions.
    Kinda like the skaven incursions, but adapted to beastmen. And increased probability if the chaos invasion has been triggered.
