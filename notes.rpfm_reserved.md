TODO:
- Review Aztec Invasion.
- Review Vermintide.
- Expand Last Stand with more faction-exclusive armies
- Expand Last Stand with more situations.
- Implement beastmen incursion? Not in a hurry, needs planning.
- Implement a tale of two empires (massive war between cathay and the empire across the darklands).
- Implement the hunger games (many factions attack lustria at the same time, and becomes a battle royale).
- Implement Three Kingdoms 2: Electric Boogaloo (the 3 strongest factions get buffed and go against each other).
- Implement Ordertide (all order factions ally against the chaos factions).
- Implement The Last Crusade (bretonnia declares war on the entire world, maybe excluded wood elves).
- Implement empire/bretonia/high elves/dark elves/cathay/kislev endgame disasters.
